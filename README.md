# Obsidian CLI

A terminal-based interface for managing daily notes in Obsidian vaults. Built with Go and the [Charm](https://charm.sh) ecosystem (Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Glamour).

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a316f1-2010-4b51-878e-fe36f12a50d7)

## Features

- **Daily Notes** — Create and edit daily notes with section-based organization (Tasks, Ideas, Questions, Insights)
- **Eisenhower Tasks** — Tag tasks with `#do`, `#delegate`, `#schedule`, `#eliminate` and view them in an interactive matrix
- **File Browser** — Navigate your full Obsidian vault with directory browsing and global fuzzy search (`/`)
- **Inline Editing** — View files with Glamour-rendered markdown, edit with a built-in textarea editor
- **Central Logging** — All tasks, ideas, questions, and insights logged to separate central files with backlinks
- **Adaptive Colors** — Catppuccin palette with automatic light/dark terminal detection

## Install

### From source (requires Go 1.25+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caneppelevitor/obsidian-cli.git
cd obsidian-cli

# Option A: go install (puts binary in ~/go/bin/)
go install .

# Option B: make install (puts binary in /usr/local/bin/)
make install
```

### Verify

```bash
obsidian --help
```

## Setup

```bash
obsidian init
```

This will prompt you for:
1. **Daily notes path** — where daily notes are created (e.g. `~/vault/daily-notes`)
2. **Vault root path** — root directory for the file browser (e.g. `~/vault`)

Configuration is stored in `~/.obsidian-cli/config.yaml`.

## Usage

```bash
obsidian              # Opens today's daily note (default)
obsidian daily        # Same as above
obsidian tasks        # View and manage tasks from CLI
obsidian config       # View config status
obsidian config --edit  # Edit config in $EDITOR
```
